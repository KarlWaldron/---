Wang Shao's Notes
This is where Wang Shao's notes are recorded. Wang Shao's Notes

Preface Camus said that life is absurd, but if you ask me, it is actually more like a kind of chaos. That's right, I used to think that I was an absurd philosopher, but now I find that I am actually a garbage philosopher. There is a saying that goes, put all kinds of books together, they will communicate with each other and create new things. I have always advocated a stitched theory, that is, in modern society, everyone is a stitched theory. Because the knowledge I have absorbed, the books I have read, the short videos I have watched, the art I like, and the roads I have walked have created unique individuals. How should I define myself? Kurt Cobain represents the spirit of grunge rock, so I decided to become a representative of grunge philosophy. When I first started writing this article, I felt that I was possessed by Camus, and then I found that there was another Cobain. So I think it's better to become a rubbish (oil stains, nirvana) philosophy. But according to the spirit of garbage classification, we still have to sort out the garbage and classify it.

Garbage daily life - in a peaceful life, garbage is everywhere

In today's society, there is toilet paper literature and garbage talk shows everywhere. Academic garbage, life dregs.

Yang Li's words, men, garbage! Touching people's hearts. I think she can also participate in the discussion of garbage philosophy.

What is popular in 2024? Pulling a big pile, moving shit everywhere, and all kinds of toilet girls. Young people are restless and have no jobs, but they will have garbage emotions.

There is a saying in the United States, called taking it out of your own asshole, referring to things that have just been edited.

ChatGPT said that the book I wrote is messy and the thinking jumps. To be honest, you will feel the same way when you go to the landfill. Sorry, this is the characteristic of garbage philosophy. Have you seen Shit Mountain Code? This is Shit Mountain Literature. But Shit Mountain Code is actually Jinshan Code, because it can make money. Shit Mountain Literature is also Jinshan Literature, because it can bring enlightenment to people.

How to define yourself? A Lu'an native, I went to college in Shanghai for 5 years, lived in Chicago for 5 years, and became a Chicago native. I've been to New York, and I'm a New Yorker. I've been to Houston for 6 months, and I've also been a Texas cowboy. I'm also a manic guitarist who's a local product of Seattle. Later, I returned to China, and had another reverse cultural shock. So I'm both American and Lu'an. That is, I'm a northerner in the United States, and I'm also a southerner in the United States.

My old lady's house I don't know why, but since I was a child, I've always said old ladies, but they were actually my grandpa's parents. Male old lady, female old lady. The old lady's house is a typical Qing Dynasty ancient earthen house. I've been to Mao Zedong's former residence in Shaoshan, a house made of earthen walls, and if you shrink it 6 times, it's almost my old lady's house. The old lady likes to raise chickens, and there's often a smell of chicken shit in the yard. The old lady is actually a very honest person. But she is the son of a martyr, and her father became a Communist martyr, but later he was arrested and became a member of the Kuomintang. So I have both Kuomintang and Communist blood in me. What's even more outrageous is that I first have Communist blood and then Kuomintang blood. I am also quite confused.

Take this time when I went back to my alma mater to attend an expert lecture as an example. Every time there was a huge amount of traffic, I refused to accept it and had to start from zero. Maybe I just like the state of reaching the maximum level and then returning to zero. That is the so-called reset point and restart. Since I am already immortal, I will provide some emotional value to the public, which is the meaning of my existence. Some people say that it is just like Mao Zedong in the 1970s. Everyone is actually tired and can't play with the chairman. But it's okay to tell the truth. After everyone has experienced absurd things, they will know the importance of laws and regulations. In other words, instead of expecting a savior to save the people from water and fire. From another perspective, this Messiah may also be the source of chaos. Therefore, the personal leadership charm must eventually be standardized into rules and regulations. I think in general, I am still a relatively rule-abiding person, and I stick to my principles. Maybe this kind of dancing with shackles and doing the temple in the snail shell within the rules is the happiness I ultimately pursue. I think I am also quite passive

Shanghai University has many winding roads. According to the school, the road to truth is tortuous. Every time I drove to a fork in the road, Secretary Ding would say that the earth is round, but when I arrived in Seattle, he would say, hey, but the road in Seattle is curved. In fact, no matter how you go around, you will eventually reach Rome. I firmly believe in this. Just as Chairman Mao always emphasized, victory will be achieved in the end.

Some people died at the age of 22, and some people were still hopeless programmers at the age of 32. Less than a month after joining the company, they were killed by Bao Yinni. What can I do? Quietly wait for the arrival of the 35-year-old line. I talked to a pancake seller downstairs in Jing'an Temple. If I can't find a job, I will sell pancakes. I also asked Starbucks and McDonald's in Jing'an District, and they seemed to be willing to accept me. It seems that there are still many places willing to accept me.

After reading "A Record of the Western Regions of the Great Tang Dynasty", I realized that Xuanzang was not a royal brother who brought customs documents, but a few monks who wanted to go to the West to obtain scriptures, but the official did not allow it, so Xuanzang went to India by himself. Chinese people always feel that they need something official to be assured. Government-sponsored students are always more useful than monks who sneak out of the country. But sometimes you have to break the rules! Chinese people always feel that they have to have a series of documents to pass the customs. In fact, it is not true. He just walked the line, and he went to many places. The most mysterious thing is that Xuanzang also learned foreign languages, went to communicate with Indian temples, and returned to his motherland after the communication.

Why did I go to Jing'an Temple to eat the offerings in front of Sakyamuni? Director Sheng of Shanghai Mental Health Center did not understand. Simply put, it is this logic: since everyone can become a Buddha, whether you can become a Buddha depends on yourself, so as long as you think you are a Buddha, then you are a Buddha. Becoming a Buddha does not depend on the outside, but only on the inside. In other words, everyone can be a Buddha. As a Buddha, there is nothing wrong with me running to take the offerings in front of the Buddha. I did see real monks at the place where incense was burned that day in Jing'an Temple. Real Buddhism is actually atheism, and real Zen does not care about the form of expression. My master asked me, are you grateful because the fruit nourishes my body? I said yes...but I actually paid 50 yuan for the ticket, so...

Mao Zedong, Sun Wu, and Cao Cao often accompany me to watch the sea in my dreams. Cao Cao's poem says, "Watching the vast sea." Mao Zedong also had a poem. They both watched the vast sea after doing something great, and I also watched the sea after doing something great for the country. I knew it was the vast sea at the first sight of that image. Before, Mao Zedong and Cao Cao looked at the American continent from the direction of China, and I looked at my hometown from the American continent. I helped them see the scenery they didn't see.

Garbage still needs to be sorted

In fact, spiritual power is very good, especially when used in rock music. That kind of vigorous and vigorous vitality should be recorded as the wildness of rock music. Listening to heavy metal more and playing it more will indeed produce different things. Find order in disorder. I actually like the improvisation and exploration of jazz music. After all, no two jazz concerts are the same, and this is the essence of jazz.

Shanghai seems to have never been a rock city. The flavor of this city should still be classical music, like the beautiful Jiangnan Pipa and the classical piano. The grunge rock of Seattle, America, seems to be too advanced for the city of Shanghai.

For Caesar, the triumphal ceremony is not surprising, and he is happy only when he defeats himself.

That kind of anger, that kind of madness, and the kind of rebelliousness of the trapped beast are all excellent qualities in me. Some people are like Sisyphus, doing the same job every day, while some people are like Prometheus, brave enough to steal fire.

The clown is also a joker. In the bicycle poker, the king rides a bicycle. It is obviously Karl the Great, but he rides a bicycle, which is the joker. But in poker, the joker is the biggest. Isn't this a manifestation of contradiction?

When I protested to booking, the policeman who asked me out of the company told me that my glory should be used elsewhere. Burning myself and lighting others, this is the meaning of my existence.

Turn the tide against the wind, and ride the waves with the wind. This is me. Someone asked me why I put myself in a disadvantageous position? I can only say that it is because I am happier this way. There is a cartoon called Kaiji, the rogue in adversity. Kaiji will burst out with great spiritual power when he has to rebel. And I always feel that the "your life is like a candle in the wind" in Yu-Gi-Oh can inspire inspiration. Whether I played CF or World of Tanks before, I had a sense of blood turning the tide. I think my essence, my heart, is actually looking forward to exciting battles! !

Even if the wings are broken, the bird can continue to fly. Just like without the tip of the gun, it can still stab people to death.

In Seattle, my nickname is "The Bat". Now, Bat has grown into a man. In Microsoft, I got a nickname called "AI Rocker". In Shanghai, I got a nickname called "AI Killer".

Are you asking me if I am happy to hang people? Of course I am happy! Real name point drill, you ask me whether to criticize Bao Yini? I will criticize him to death. I also want to write a rock song called "Call Die. Bao Yini". The specific reference is the song "Die, Sato" by the band Sacred Exile. Bao Yini, don't leave, let's wait and see about the rock bands opposite Jing'an Temple!

Damn, I think some of the things I wrote are really good, with a kind of beauty that sucks people in.

Miracle Night

It is pasted on the head of the pianist, the pianist has tried his best. Please don't shoot the pianist. In 2022, I wrote these words in the little red room.

I still remember that night in 2022, I wrote on my mobile phone in the little red room that everyone is an emperor, because they are born wearing . That night in 2022, youtube music accompanied me. It seems that the world revolves around me.

It is written in the Seattle airport that when humans plan, God is happy.

I submitted a manuscript to the Shanghai Municipal Government, saying that it suggested that the Shanghai Municipal Government put a panda on the street for a walk. The city government said it was a golden idea. They are the best.

At the Booking meeting, they said, "That's a lot of 3s". This is actually related to Monty Python. King Arthur in the book couldn't count to 3. That's why Gabe couldn't count to 3. Why did I pay attention to this strange place? At another meeting, I heard a saying that if you have an idea, you should continue to implement it. Most ideas just stay at the idea stage.

In the war theory, it is said that the damage caused by the commander's recklessness is better than the damage caused by your hesitation. Why? Because he was not timid, but because of the consequences of daring to act.

No. 600 Wanping South Road (I have wanted to use this title for a long time!)

Previous story: After Zhao Gou and Qin Hui, the two dogs, called Yue Fei and Yue Pengju back with 18 golden medals, they chopped off Yue Pengju's head with a dragon head guillotine, but unexpectedly, Yue Fei's body glued the head back together. Yue Fei said to Zhao Gou, "Is everything alright? I'm going home now." He returned home in front of everyone, and cursed Qin Hui and Zhao Gou on his phone on WeChat Moments, Zhihu, WeChat, and Bilibili. The next morning, Yue Fei got up, and before he brushed his teeth or washed his face, his father-in-law asked him, "Do you want to go to Wanping South Road to have a look?" Yue Fei typed a ❓, saying, "Let's go and have a look together. Mental illness is generally hereditary." Yue Fei told his father-in-law, "We'll live in a mental hospital for the rest of our lives!" After entering, I found out, "Oh my god, isn't this Aunt Bao? What kind of madness has driven you in?" A comrade from the National Security Bureau told me that in the end, one of the cult leaders will end up in a mental hospital after a fight. I'm not being polite with you. I'll exchange one for the other, and we'll go in together. We'll live in Wanping South Road for the rest of our lives!" Feynman said at the time that this psychiatrist was not as good as a witch doctor. Chinese medicine at least gave me a reason to say that there was a lot of dampness. The psychiatrist didn't give a reason directly, and the question was medical. Oh, who hasn't worked in a medical company? Do you think I have a line with the US Food and Drug Administration for nothing? Back to the question: Western medicine says I am terminally ill, and Chinese medicine says I am fine. Then should I listen to both sides, Chinese medicine, witch doctors, Western medicine, Mongolian doctors, and psychologists to know the result.

The only dividing line between a madman and a genius is whether or not he has made achievements. John Nash was diagnosed with schizophrenia, but it did not affect John Nash from becoming one of the greatest mathematicians.

No. 600, Wanping South Road, my hometown forever. We often come and go, talking and laughing.

Hello everyone, I am Yang Guo Yang Gaizhi, my father Yang Kang. I have already recognized my father as a thief. When? Look at the appearance, it's easy to say if you are handsome. —Wang Buzhi, 2022

A few days ago, I went to the band and distributed water to the band members. They said so much water, water king. I asked how you knew my nickname in high school was Water King [circling]

Anyway, every time I make a scene in the Heavenly Palace, I go back to being that stinky monkey. I'll get used to it. The journey to obtain the scriptures is long. Although the state of Nirvana is good, it can't be maintained for too long. So I think I still have to improve myself.

Camus said that the only serious philosophical problem is suicide. Then dying in a car accident is indeed absurd. What's even more absurd is being reborn in a car accident. In that car accident, in the haze, I felt that my head was completely crooked, and I felt like my soul was out of my body. But there was a magical force that corrected my crooked body. I left a scar on my head, reminding me not to go back.

No one told Caesar to cross the Rubicon. No one told Leonardo da Vinci that he should paint the Mona Lisa. All great works should actually come from their own agility.

Great future. All good things, bad things, are actually good things. Because you will eventually become you
